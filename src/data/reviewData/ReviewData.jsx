        review: `Really good choice for both vegetarians and for non vegetarians. Lots of options
In starters I specially liked hara bhara kabab( didnâ€™t liked anywhere else)
Other starters, main course, deserts everything was good. Ambience is really nice but service was not up to the mark. Didnâ€™t like pan shot.
That cute little cooker gola supersized everyone.`

        review:   `Coming to the review , the food is horrible in taste , All the food item which was served was cold and even on telling the staff they brought again the cold food ,
Service is toooooo slow , no one cares whether you are sitting hungry or what you want they are in their own world,
Ordered a drink and told them that ice cubes have something inside it , they didnâ€™t even changed and it served the same ice cubes which destroyed my drink,
And vegetarian person please donâ€™t go there because same stick they are having for non veg and veg and to my surprise again they are not even wearing gloves and serving the same food to vegetarian with the non veg hands.
If you compare the price itâ€™s same as the big brands bbq nation and absolute bbq , why not to go to them instead of coming here ?
To be honest Iâ€™m writing this review with upset stomach and probably food poisoning,
And to my surprise when they came to me for 5 star review i told them these points and they were like then also give 5 star review , never trust the reviews itâ€™s all fake , If you are investing this much money better to go for other brands`

        review: `Starters were very yummy specially prawns, fish and the chicken wings. The ambience was beautiful. We were served by Mr. Roshan Singh. He was genuine and asked us for our preferences and if It was a celebration. A good chap, I must say. My mum had a great time :) the deserts could be a bummer but overall a really good place`
